# Workout Tracker

## Description

Use this app to view, create, and track daily workouts. You can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day and track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise. For cardio, you can track distance. On the Dashboard, you can view the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts as well as the total duration of each workout.

This application is deployed using Heroku and Mongo Atlas. You can find the deployed application [here](https://workout-tracker-1-15.herokuapp.com/).
